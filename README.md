We are developing a smart bot that utilizes augmented reality (AR) to assist in controlling home appliances via Wi-Fi, simplifying connectivity and management. The bot provides users with an intuitive interface, enabling them to operate appliances through AR, offering real-time guidance and control. Accompanied by a mobile app, the system allows users to remotely monitor and manage their appliances from anywhere, ensuring efficient operation and ease of use. This solution enhances home automation, offering convenience, flexibility, and improved appliance performance through smart, user-friendly controls.
